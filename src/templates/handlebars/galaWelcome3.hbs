    <p>After a successful alpha release, the countdown to April 14, 2020 and the beta release of Town Star is on.</p>
    <p>You’ll be ready with your Beta Key too.</p>
    <p>But have you gotten to know the “game before the game”?</p>
    <p>There’s a race underway to collect parts to build a Town Star FarmBot.</p>
    <p>The FarmBot is a unique digital game item players can own and control.</p>
    <p>It’s going to require many parts to assemble one, but if you do, you can send your FarmBot out in the game world
      to
      mine BoxCoin.</p>
    <p>There is no other way that BoxCoins come into existence.</p>
    <p>What is BoxCoin?</p>
    <p>BoxCoin is the premium game reward in Town Star.</p>
    <p>BoxCoin can give you an edge by speeding up your town's production or used to purchase unique game items, as is
      common in builder games.</p>
    <p>To start building your FarmBot grab a Loot Box. Grab several even.</p>
    <p>Even if you don’t manage to complete the full build, these parts are rare, and FarmBot parts WILL be sought out.
    </p>
    <p>Super cool.</p>
    <p>Go now to participate in the “game before the game”</p>
