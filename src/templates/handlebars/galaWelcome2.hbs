      Gala network.</p>
    <p>Imagine the kind of impact that may have for a moment and realize you are now a part of it.</p>
    <p>Exciting enough to make the hair on your arm stand up, eh? Yes!</p>
    <p>It won’t hurt that the first game on Gala, Town Star, is from the creative minds behind Farmville and Farmville
      2.
